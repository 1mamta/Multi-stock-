NIFTY-50 Stock Trend Analyzer
This is a final project that applies machine learning to identify and predict trends in stock market sectors. 
The project creates an end-to-end data science pipeline that goes from raw data to actionable insights, all within an interactive web application.
Project Overview
The goal is to automate the process of spotting bullish or bearish trends across different stock sectors. Instead of looking at individual stock performance, this analyzer provides a high-level view of the entire NIFTY-50 index. 
It's built for those who want data-driven recommendations without having to be a finance expert.
